## Markov Chains
Markov chains are a fairly common, and relatively simple, way to statistically model random processes. They have been used in many different domains, ranging from text generation to financial modeling. A popular example is [r/SubredditSimulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator), which uses Markov chains to automate the creation of content for an entire subreddit. Overall, Markov Chains are conceptually quite intuitive, and are very accessible in that they can be implemented without the use of any advanced statistical or mathematical concepts.  

### The Model
Formally, a Markov chain is a probabilistic automaton. The probability distribution of state transitions is typically represented as the Markov chainâ€™s transition matrix. If the Markov chain has N possible states, the matrix will be an N x N matrix, such that entry (I, J) is the probability of transitioning from state I to state J. Additionally, the transition matrix must be a stochastic matrix, a matrix whose entries in each row must add up to exactly 1.  
Additionally, a Markov chain also has an initial state vector, represented as an N x 1 matrix (a vector), that describes the probability distribution of starting at each of the N possible states. Entry I of the vector describes the probability of the chain beginning at state I.
